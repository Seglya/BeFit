                <h2>How to Get Motivated</h2>
                <p>Motivation is literally the desire to do things. It's the difference between waking up before dawn to pound the pavement and lazing around the house all day. It's the crucial element in setting and attaining goals—and research shows you can influence your own levels of motivation and self-control. So figure out what you want, power through the pain period, and start being who you want to be.</p>

                <h2>Workout at the gym</h2>
                <p>Your home is full of distractions – your computer, your TV, your cats and dogs, and the guacamole in the refrigerator. At the gym, you’ll see a lot of fit people. If you have the right mindset, this is instant inspiration of what your body can look like with consistent exercise. Even if you’re envious of them, this can fire up your competitive nature to get in better shape. Just don’t try to do everything at once and injure yourself. Consistency brings results, not a single session that leaves you crippled the next morning.</p>
